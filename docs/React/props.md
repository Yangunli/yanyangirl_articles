# [React]Props

- Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props.
- Props are read-only snapshots in time: every render receives a new version of props.
- You can’t change props. When you need interactivity, you’ll need to set state.
- **Context** lets a parent component provide data to the entire tree below it.
